### Past Projects

[Protest Trends](http://tovaperlman.github.io/MUSA550FinalProject/)

Using data from the Crowd Counting Consortium, this project analyzed trends from categories such as claims, event types and crowd size between Summer 2019 and Summer 2020 protests. I then used cenpy to determine which counties in the US had 3.5% of their population participating in protests. This rule, theorized by Erica Chenoweth, states that if 3.5% of the total population protests a specific cause then citizens can overturn the existing power and create change. Thus, my project seeks to find out if this occurred in any counties in the US in 2019 and 2020.

[Gentrification in Philadelphia](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kristinchang/KristinTova508Final/blob/main/MUSA508_KristinTova_Final.html)


Using new construction permits as a proxy for gentrification, my partner and I built a geospatial risk model in R that predicts gentrification in Philadelphia within the next five to ten years. We used predictors like Starbucks locations, eviction filings and grocery store access in our regression to create a more accurate picture of permit locations.

[Housing Credit Allocation Model](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tovaperlman/508_HW4_Public/blob/master/508_HW4.2.html)

Housing is a topic I am very passionate about and I was pleased to build this model in order to further explore how to target consumers for housing credits. This algorithm builds on business models using confusion matrices to determine which customers should be sent promotional materials about housing credits. Within this project, we had to decide how false negatives and false positives are viewed in a public sector environment as opposed to a business churn environment.

[Mapping Dead Sea Shrinkage using Google Earth Engine](pdf/Perlman, Tova_FinalProject.pdf)

The Dead Sea is slowly shrinking which has huge economic, political and social implications for the entire region. Using Google Earth Engine, I mapped and calculated the shrinkage and noted the correlation between the receding coast and development around the area.

[Memo to Mayor on predicting recidivism rates](pdf/MUSA508_MemoHW5.pdf)

A uniquely ugly part of the racist society we live in is its effect on mass incarceration and the lives of Black and Brown people. One project assignment encouraged us to build a model that more equitably predicts the recidivism rates among both Black and White prisoners. The link is a memo we were assigned to write to a city official encouraging them to adopt the new model. Hopefully, it illuminates the importance of strong communication and explanation surrounding algorithmic fairness and cognizance of machine biases.
